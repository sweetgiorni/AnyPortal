AnyPortal v1.0.0.0
Created by sweetgiorni
A BepInEx Valheim mod


Replaces the default portal-pairing mechanism with a dropdown to select your destination portal.


Build the solution with Visual Studio 2019. You will need to add references to the valheim and Unity dlls.


Requirements
BepInEx

Install
Copy the compiled AnyPortal.dll to BepInEx/plugins/AnyPortal/. Also copy the file "anyportal" in the root of this repository. That is the Unity AssetBundle that contains the UI prefab. At some point I will post the Unity prefab or project so as to complete this repository.
